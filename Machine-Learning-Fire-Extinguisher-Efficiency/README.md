**Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning**

**Classification R Project**

Using a public dataset available on the website link https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/vtdhnd07.php containing information about tests using fire extinguishers, a machine learning model was built to predict if a fire will be extinguished or not, alongside with previous data analysis.
